My problem sets and projects from taking the cs50 classes.

# Organized - Final Project
  Organized is a planning & budgeting web app. It has 3 levels **Event** > **Umbrellas** > **Todos**. You can use it to make todo lists, plan budgeted events etc.
  It lets you know when you are under or overbudget, you can also assign tasks and todo's to other people *(this is function is still in a very basic form and is yet to be           properly expended upon)*
  It has a wide range of uses from budgeting monthly expenses to planing big events & projects or just a simple todo list.
  Made with python(Flask) and sqlite, html, css, javascript, jquery. Please read it's readme file for more info and instal the packages in the requirements file befor running.

# Finance- 
  it's a basic stock exchange app made with python(Flask) and sqlite, html, css, javascript, jquery and Ajax. Live quotes from IEX and Payment hosted by Rave from flutterwave, you would need to create an account with both of them to get your API keys and set them as global variables, the app won't run without them. You can use the app without an email address but you can't top up your wallet balance without it. 
  PS. You can get dummy cards and dummy API keys from flutterwave's documentation. The recharge amount is in naira becasue the dummy API keys have a limit, a lower value currency lets me run more tests.

# Lab9 - 
  it's a birthday app, you can add, edit and delete birthdays. It's made with python(Flask) and sqlite,html,css and javascript.

# Pset6
DNA - this app takes a sequence of DNA and a CSV file containing STR counts for a list of individuals as a command line argument, and then matches the STR repeats to determine whom the DNA (most likely) belongs to.
