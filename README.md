My problem sets and projects from taking the cs50 classes.

#Finance- it's a basic stock exchange app made with python(Flask) and sqlite, html, css, javascript, jquery and Ajax. Live quotes from IEX and Payment hosted by Rave from flutterwave, you would need to create an account with both of them to get your API keys and set them as global variables, the app won't run without them. You can use the app without an email address but you can't top up your wallet balance without it.

#Lab9 - it's a birthday app, you can add, edit and delete birthdays. It's made with python(Flask) and sqlite,html,css and javascript.
